# COBOL Interpreter Lab

## Overview

During my compilers and languages class at Walla Walla University, my group chose to make a COBOL interpreter.

This is the resulting project.

> This interpreter is based on the work of Douglas Thain who created the [Compiler Book](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/)
